Lab Sheet 5 Encapsulation 

1. Create a class called Customer that includes three instance variables: id (int), name 
(String) and gender (char). The class contains: 
• A constructor that creates a Customer with the specified id, name and gender.  
• Provide get methods for each instance variable.  
• Provide a method toString takes no arguments. 
• Write a test program called TestCustomer to test the Customer class 


2. Create a class called Students that include instance variables: id, name, gender, 
subjectName, and marks.  
• A constructor that creates a Student with the specified : id, name, gender, 
subjectName, and marks. 
• Implement Getter and Setter methods. 
• Create a class called MarkDeatils (Main Class)  
• Inside the Main class, you need to get user input values for all the above 
variables. If the user enters an invalid mark that mark is not to be set.  
• Implement the display method to display above values  


3. Create a class Employee that include Name, EmpNo, and Salary. 
• A constructor that creates Employee with the Name, EmpNo, and Salary. 
• Implement the Getter and Setter method. 
• Create a class called EmpDetails (Main Class)  
• Inside the Main class, you need to get user input values for all the above 
variables.  
• Method to print above data. 
• You need to validate the following facts inside setter methods 
▪ The name should not be null or empty 
▪ Salary should be positive 
(You need to check with valid user input and invalid user input values and attached 
the relevant output) 


4. Create a class called Person that include instance variables: age, weight, height. 
• A constructor that creates Person with the age, weight, height 
• Implement the Getter and Setter method. 
• Create a class called BMICalculate (Main Class)  
• Inside the Main class, you need to get user input values for all the above variables 
and display those values using getter methods. 
• Method to calculate BMI value. 
• Method to getYourStatus by using following facts 
• You need to validate the following facts. 
▪ The age, weight, height should not be null or empty 
Formula: 
weight (kg) / [height (m)]2 Or [weight (kg) / height (cm) / height (cm)] x 10,000 


5. Create a class called SportDetails that includes playerName and playerAge and sport.  
• A constructor that creates SportDetails with the playerName and playerAge and sport.  
• Implement the Getter and Setter method. 
• Create a class called PlayerDetails (Main Class)  
• Inside the Main class you need get user input values and setting to the variables. 
• You need to validate following facts. 
▪ Age should be 10 – 50 years 
▪ Player Name and sport should be not null  
(You need to check with valid user input and invalid user input values and attached the
